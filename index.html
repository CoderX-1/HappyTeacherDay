  <p> Happy Teacher's Day to my favorite teacher! Wishing you joy and happiness, you are an amazing teacher, and you only deserve the best. The best teachers teach from the heart, not from the book. Thank you for being a wonderful teacher.</p>
    <span>"Better than a thousand days of diligent study is one day with a great teacher." "Your heart is slightly larger than the average human heart, but that's because you're a teacher." "Teachers can change lives with the right mix of chalk and challenges." "Teaching is the greatest act of optimism."</span> <br>
